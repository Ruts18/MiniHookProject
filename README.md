# MiniHookProject.

Hooks are functions that let you **“hook into”** React state and lifecycle features from function components.
* Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes. React provides a few built-in Hooks like useState. 
The useState hook allows us to make our function components stateful.  

When called, useState returns an array of two items
The first being our state value and the second being a function for setting or updating that value. 
The useState hook takes a single argument, the initial value for the associated piece of state, which can be of any Javascript data type.
